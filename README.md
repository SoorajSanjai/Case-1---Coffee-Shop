### KPI's 

- Market Size - 1.11 M
- Average Growth Rate - 5%
- Average Profit - 173K
- Price customer is willing to pay (average) - 1.96$
- No of competitors - 5
- Averageno of cups of coffee consumed in a day - 1
- Averageprice of a coffee - 2.87$ 
- Averageprice of snacks - 3.10$ 

### General Observations
1.	**Beverages:**
- Mocha: Highest contribution to total price.
- Black Coffee: Lowest contribution to total price.
- Implication: Offering more varieties of mocha or promoting it can increase revenue. Black coffee, being the cheapest, can attract price-sensitive customers.
2.	**Snacks:**
- Sandwich: Highest contribution to total price.
- Cookies: Lowest contribution to total price.
- Implication: Emphasizing sandwiches in the menu can boost sales, while cookies can serve as a low-cost option to complement coffee sales.

**No Correlation Between Costs and Market Share**
- Observation: There is no clear relationship between the price competitors charge for their products and their market share.
- Implication: This means market share is influenced by factors other than price, such as quality, customer service, location, and brand loyalty. Therefore, focusing solely on pricing strategy might not be sufficient; other aspects like ambiance, customer engagement, and unique offerings are crucial for attracting and retaining customers.

   - Monthly cost: $750 * 25 days = **$18,750**
2. **Cost to prepare snacks:**
   - Daily cost: 250 snacks * $2.00 = **$500**

3. **Total monthly preparation cost:**
   - $18,750 (coffee) + $12,500 (snacks) = **$31,250**
4. **Monthly administrative costs:**
   - Rent, electricity, etc.: **$11,000**
5. **Total monthly operational cost:**
   - $31,250 (preparation) + $11,000 (administrative) = **$42,250**

- **Coffee Sales:**
  - 500 people (1 cup each) * $2.50 per cup = **$1,250** per day
- **Snack Sales:**
  - 250 people (1 snack each) * $2.80 per snack = **$700** per day
- **Total Revenue:**
  - ($1,250 + $700) * 25 days = **$48,750** per month

**Monthly Costs:**
- **Inventory Costs:**
  - Coffee: $750 per day * 25 days = **$18,750**
  - Snacks: $500 per day * 25 days = **$12,500**

**Profit:**
- **Total Revenue:** **$48,750**
- **Total Costs:** **$42,250**
- **Profit:** **$6,500**

**Conclusion:**
The estimated monthly profit, considering lower-than-average prices to attract customers ( and account for potential low customer in the store), is approximately **$6,500**. This estimate does not factor in the initial setup costs, focusing solely on monthly operational profitability.

* While the monthly profit projection of **$$6,500** is promising, it is based on conservative estimates. Any deviation in costs or revenue can impact profitability.

**Experience and Relationships:**

* Starting a coffee shop without prior experience and established supplier relationships can lead to higher operational costs and inefficiencies.
* Hiring experienced staff or partnering with someone with industry experience could mitigate this risk.

**Competition:**

* Entering a market with five established competitors requires a strong differentiation strategy.
* Without unique offerings or a solid competitive edge, it will be challenging to capture market share.

**Market Dynamics:**

* The coffee market near the university is growing at 5%, indicating potential.
* However, capturing a significant portion of this growth requires strategic planning and marketing efforts.



## Final Decision

**Based on the analysis:**

* **Risks:** High competition, lack of experience, no supplier relationships, significant initial investment.
* **Potential Rewards:** Growing market, promising profit projections with conservative estimates.

**Recommendation:**

While the financial projections are optimistic, the lack of experience and supplier relationships combined with high competition presents significant risks. I would recommend not starting the coffee shop at this time. Instead, consider:

* Gaining industry experience.
* Building relationships with suppliers.
* Developing a strong competitive strategy before entering the market.

Alternatively, partnering with someone who has experience in the coffee shop industry could also be a viable path forward.

## Recommendations for Overcoming Challenges and Increasing Success

This section outlines steps to mitigate identified risks and improve the coffee shop's chances of thriving in the competitive market:

**Gain Industry Knowledge:**

* **Recruit Experienced Staff:** Hiring a manager and baristas with coffee shop experience provides invaluable knowledge for daily operations and establishing best practices.
* **Consult Experts:** Seek guidance from industry consultants or successful coffee shop owners. Their insights and advice on menu development, supplier negotiations, and marketing strategies can be instrumental.

**Build Strong Supplier Relationships:**

* **Research Potential Suppliers:** Early research into coffee bean suppliers, milk producers, and other vendors allows for building strong relationships that ensure reliable product quality and potentially secure better pricing.
* **Partner with Local Suppliers:** Whenever possible, consider partnering with local coffee roasters or distributors. This benefits the local economy, offers potentially fresher products, and may reduce shipping costs.

**Differentiate Your Shop:**

* **Develop a Unique Selling Point (USP):**  A compelling USP sets you apart from competitors. This could be unique coffee blends, a curated atmosphere (cozy, modern), high-quality pastries, or exceptional customer service.
* **Implement Loyalty Programs:** Reward repeat customers and incentivize them to return with loyalty programs.
* **Engage with the University Community:** Actively connect by hosting events, offering student discounts, or partnering with student organizations.
* **Cater to Diverse Preferences:** Offer a variety of coffee options and price points to suit students on a budget.

**Strategic Pricing:**

* **Leverage Price Sensitivity:**  The market is price-sensitive. Consider offering coffee options at a slightly lower price point than the average (e.g., $1.80 vs. $2.80) to attract budget-conscious customers. 

**Manage Finances Effectively:**

* **Control Costs:** Monitor expenses closely to identify areas for cost savings. Negotiate competitive rates for rent and utilities to optimize the budget.

**Implement Effective Marketing Strategies:**

* **Target Marketing:** Focus marketing efforts on university students and staff. Utilize social media platforms to reach this demographic and offer student discounts and promotions.
* **Establish a Strong Online Presence:**  Develop a user-friendly website and active social media profiles showcasing unique offerings and promotions.
* **Launch Promotional Activities:** Attract new customers initially with special offers and introductory discounts.

**Monitor and Adapt Continuously:**

* **Solicit Customer Feedback:** Regularly gather customer feedback to understand preferences and identify areas for improvement. Be prepared to adapt offerings and approach based on their input.
* **Track Performance:** Monitor key metrics like daily sales, customer traffic, and social media engagement. Analyze this data to identify what's working and adjust strategies to optimize performance.

By implementing these recommendations and remaining adaptable, the coffee shop can significantly increase its chances of success in the competitive market. However, it's important to acknowledge that even with careful planning, inherent risks remain.
